- Best for people who have horrrible battery life on For mid-ranged/flagship devices (Nexus 6p, Note 3, Mi Max, s6 etc...)
- Support will be added soon for cheapscate devices (1ghz processor, 1gb ram)
-Â Dynamism in every aspect(lmk, fast charge values etc)

## Methodology
- Optimise android values using shell scripts (Bash) and many others (build.prop tweaks...etc)

## Requirement
- Custom recovery
- Custom kernel
- A working Brain

## Features
List will be coming up soon!

Yet to arive
- Shell script in /system/bin that allows more customisation and more interactive with a GUI. An app may be implemented if i have time
- Dynamic update binary to detect ram or processor speed and decide on what profile to install(battery/ performance)
- Much more governer tweaks for the sake of saving battery (considering to merge govtuner source)
- Improved script structure for better and more efficient execution (and dynamic!)
- Improved script values (setprop, etc...)

### FAQ (Freaking Annoying Questions)
Q: How to update?
- Just flash the new zip. The old scripts will be automatically cleared and replaced

- Performance is the enemy of Battery. Making them kiss and make up is impossible

Q: Can I use your scripts?
- Ask for permission (XDA PM). PLease state your purpose too (whatcha gonna do with the scripts) You have to ask for permission. No response means no.
