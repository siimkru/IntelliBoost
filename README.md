### FAQ (Freaking Annoying Questions)
Q: Why cant you make a version with good performance and good battery?

A: Performance is the enemy of Battery. Making them kiss and make up is impossible

Q: Help! My logs say that the script failed!

A: For the last time, YOU NEED BUSYBOX [Playstore (sterricson) || flashable zip (YashdSaraf)] 

Q: Can I use your scripts?

A: Ask for permission (XDA PM). PLease state your purpose too (whatcha gonna do with the scripts) You have to ask for permission in addition to GNU Public License v3
No response means no.
